    <p style="font-size:40px">My name is Sarkodie Adu Frimpong . I was born on 5th september,2006 in troindheim,Norway.
        I grew up in a family of engineers and entrepreneurs,which sparked my interest in technology,problem solving
        and innovation from a young age.My parents encouraged my curiosity by providing me with robotic kits and LEGO sets.
        During high school,I excelled in mathematics,science and physics. I learnt robotics and coding on my own from this site 
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard " target="_blank">The Odin's project</a>and also watched 
        a lot of programmimg competitions and tech events  which deepened my passion for computer engineering.

    designing and building devices as well as writing code to control and interact with them. I see computer engineering as the 
    best field where i can be creative and explore my curiosity. My goal is to develop innovative technologies that can improve 
    people's lives, such as artificial intelligence, internet of things and cyber security systems. </p>
    <P style="font-size:40px">After completing my undergraduate degree, i plan to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Engineering and specialize in AI
         and machine learning. my aim is to work in the tech industry, designing and developing cutting-edge technologies that can
          solve real-world problems and maybe oneday have a company of my own . My ultimate goal is to become a leading expert in my
